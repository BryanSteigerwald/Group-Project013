4. Application Name
FindMyClass

5. Application Description
Our application, named "FindMyClass", is designed to streamline the process of exploring and validating courses available in the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) database. With the ever-expanding array of courses offered by academic institutions, navigating through them to find relevant ones can be a daunting task. FindMyClass aims to alleviate this challenge by providing users with a user-friendly interface to search for any class available in the CU Boulder database.

Through FindMyClass, users can effortlessly search for courses by entering keywords, course codes, or specific criteria. The application will then retrieve and display comprehensive information about each course, including its title, description, instructor, schedule, prerequisites, and any other relevant details. This functionality not only simplifies the process of finding courses but also enables users to make well-informed decisions about their academic pursuits. Whether students are planning their course schedules, exploring new subjects, or seeking prerequisites for advanced classes, FindMyClass will serve as a valuable tool in their academic journey.

6. Vision Statement
For students at CU Boulder who are frustrated by lack of streamlined navigation when seeing course options, FindMyClass is an application that simplifies course search and selection. Unlike the 'Search Classes' webpage of CU Boulder, our product aims to provide students with easily nagivatable course details that allow for them to make informed academic decisions with ease.
